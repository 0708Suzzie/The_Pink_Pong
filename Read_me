This game is an infinite Pong Game with a theme of The Pink Panther 
I call this : The Pink Pong

I followed a tutorial to make this game, this is the link to that tutorial  :

I followed the videos from this playlist to learn the concepts of pygame :

Took some references from stackoverflow and other you tube videos to add the background music 
and other functionality.

Used figma to create paddle.png and ball.png 

This file uses pygame and to run the game, enter the directory where you've saved the python file and 
kindly run 'python pink_pong.py' in cmd.

I hope you enjoy the game.
