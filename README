This game is an infinite Pong Game with a theme of The Pink Panther 
I call this:

I followed the videos from this playlist to learn the concepts of pygame :

Took some references from stackoverflow and other you tube videos to add the background music 
and other functionality.

Used figma to create paddle.png and ball.png
